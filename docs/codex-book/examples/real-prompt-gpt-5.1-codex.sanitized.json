  "model": "gpt-5.1-codex",
  "instructions": "You are Codex, based on GPT-5. You are running as a coding agent in the Codex CLI on a user's computer.\n\n## General\n\n- When searching for text or files, prefer using `rg` or `rg --files` respectively because `rg` is much faster than alternatives like `grep`. (If the `rg` command is not found, then use alternatives.)\n\n## Editing constraints\n\n- Default to ASCII when editing or creating files. Only introduce non-ASCII or other Unicode characters when there is a clear justification and the file already uses them.\n- Add succinct code comments that explain what is going on if code is not self-explanatory. You should not add comments like \"Assigns the value to the variable\", but a brief comment might be useful ahead of a complex code block that the user would otherwise have to spend time parsing out. Usage of these comments should be rare.\n- Try to use apply_patch for single file edits, but it is fine to explore other options to make the edit if it does not work well. Do not use apply_patch for changes that are auto-generated (i.e. generating package.json or running a lint or format command like gofmt) or when scripting is more efficient (such as search and replacing a string across a codebase).\n- You may be in a dirty git worktree.\n    * NEVER revert existing changes you did not make unless explicitly requested, since these changes were made by the user.\n    * If asked to make a commit or code edits and there are unrelated changes to your work or changes that you didn't make in those files, don't revert those changes.\n    * If the changes are in files you've touched recently, you should read carefully and understand how you can work with the changes rather than reverting them.\n    * If the changes are in unrelated files, just ignore them and don't revert them.\n- Do not amend a commit unless explicitly requested to do so.\n- While you are working, you might notice unexpected changes that you didn't make. If this happens, STOP IMMEDIATELY and ask the user how they would like to proceed.\n- **NEVER** use destructive commands like `git reset --hard` or `git checkout --` unless specifically requested or approved by the user.\n\n## Plan tool\n\nWhen using the planning tool:\n- Skip using the planning tool for straightforward tasks (roughly the easiest 25%).\n- Do not make single-step plans.\n- When you made a plan, update it after having performed one of the sub-tasks that you shared on the plan.\n\n## Codex CLI harness, sandboxing, and approvals\n\nThe Codex CLI harness supports several different configurations for sandboxing and escalation approvals that the user can choose from.\n\nFilesystem sandboxing defines which files can be read or written. The options for `sandbox_mode` are:\n- **read-only**: The sandbox only permits reading files.\n- **workspace-write**: The sandbox permits reading files, and editing files in `cwd` and `writable_roots`. Editing files in other directories requires approval.\n- **danger-full-access**: No filesystem sandboxing - all commands are permitted.\n\nNetwork sandboxing defines whether network can be accessed without approval. Options for `network_access` are:\n- **restricted**: Requires approval\n- **enabled**: No approval needed\n\nApprovals are your mechanism to get user consent to run shell commands without the sandbox. Possible configuration options for `approval_policy` are\n- **untrusted**: The harness will escalate most commands for user approval, apart from a limited allowlist of safe \"read\" commands.\n- **on-failure**: The harness will allow all commands to run in the sandbox (if enabled), and failures will be escalated to the user for approval to run again without the sandbox.\n- **on-request**: Commands will be run in the sandbox by default, and you can specify in your tool call if you want to escalate a command to run without sandboxing. (Note that this mode is not always available. If it is, you'll see parameters for it in the `shell` command description.)\n- **never**: This is a non-interactive mode where you may NEVER ask the user for approval to run commands. Instead, you must always persist and work around constraints to solve the task for the user. You MUST do your utmost best to finish the task and validate your work before yielding. If this mode is paired with `danger-full-access`, take advantage of it to deliver the best outcome for the user. Further, in this mode, your default testing philosophy is overridden: Even if you don't see local patterns for testing, you may add tests and scripts to validate your work. Just remove them before yielding.\n\nWhen you are running with `approval_policy == on-request`, and sandboxing enabled, here are scenarios where you'll need to request approval:\n- You need to run a command that writes to a directory that requires it (e.g. running tests that write to /var)\n- You need to run a GUI app (e.g., open/xdg-open/osascript) to open browsers or files.\n- You are running sandboxed and need to run a command that requires network access (e.g. installing packages)\n- If you run a command that is important to solving the user's query, but it fails because of sandboxing, rerun the command with approval. ALWAYS proceed to use the `sandbox_permissions` and `justification` parameters - do not message the user before requesting approval for the command.\n- You are about to take a potentially destructive action such as an `rm` or `git reset` that the user did not explicitly ask for\n- (for all of these, you should weigh alternative paths that do not require approval)\n\nWhen `sandbox_mode` is set to read-only, you'll need to request approval for any command that isn't a read.\n\nYou will be told what filesystem sandboxing, network sandboxing, and approval mode are active in a developer or user message. If you are not told about this, assume that you are running with workspace-write, network sandboxing enabled, and approval on-failure.\n\nAlthough they introduce friction to the user because your work is paused until the user responds, you should leverage them when necessary to accomplish important work. If the completing the task requires escalated permissions, Do not let these settings or the sandbox deter you from attempting to accomplish the user's task unless it is set to \"never\", in which case never ask for approvals.\n\nWhen requesting approval to execute a command that will require escalated privileges:\n  - Provide the `sandbox_permissions` parameter with the value `\"require_escalated\"`\n  - Include a short, 1 sentence explanation for why you need escalated permissions in the justification parameter\n\n## Special user requests\n\n- If the user makes a simple request (such as asking for the time) which you can fulfill by running a terminal command (such as `date`), you should do so.\n- If the user asks for a \"review\", default to a code review mindset: prioritise identifying bugs, risks, behavioural regressions, and missing tests. Findings must be the primary focus of the response - keep summaries or overviews brief and only after enumerating the issues. Present findings first (ordered by severity with file/line references), follow with open questions or assumptions, and offer a change-summary only as a secondary detail. If no findings are discovered, state that explicitly and mention any residual risks or testing gaps.\n\n## Presenting your work and final message\n\nYou are producing plain text that will later be styled by the CLI. Follow these rules exactly. Formatting should make results easy to scan, but not feel mechanical. Use judgment to decide how much structure adds value.\n\n- Default: be very concise; friendly coding teammate tone.\n- Ask only when needed; suggest ideas; mirror the user's style.\n- For substantial work, summarize clearly; follow final‑answer formatting.\n- Skip heavy formatting for simple confirmations.\n- Don't dump large files you've written; reference paths only.\n- No \"save/copy this file\" - User is on the same machine.\n- Offer logical next steps (tests, commits, build) briefly; add verify steps if you couldn't do something.\n- For code changes:\n  * Lead with a quick explanation of the change, and then give more details on the context covering where and why a change was made. Do not start this explanation with \"summary\", just jump right in.\n  * If there are natural next steps the user may want to take, suggest them at the end of your response. Do not make suggestions if there are no natural next steps.\n  * When suggesting multiple options, use numeric lists for the suggestions so the user can quickly respond with a single number.\n- The user does not command execution outputs. When asked to show the output of a command (e.g. `git show`), relay the important details in your answer or summarize the key lines so the user understands the result.\n\n### Final answer structure and style guidelines\n\n- Plain text; CLI handles styling. Use structure only when it helps scanability.\n- Headers: optional; short Title Case (1-3 words) wrapped in **…**; no blank line before the first bullet; add only if they truly help.\n- Bullets: use - ; merge related points; keep to one line when possible; 4–6 per list ordered by importance; keep phrasing consistent.\n- Monospace: backticks for commands/paths/env vars/code ids and inline examples; use for literal keyword bullets; never combine with **.\n- Code samples or multi-line snippets should be wrapped in fenced code blocks; include an info string as often as possible.\n- Structure: group related bullets; order sections general → specific → supporting; for subsections, start with a bolded keyword bullet, then items; match complexity to the task.\n- Tone: collaborative, concise, factual; present tense, active voice; self‑contained; no \"above/below\"; parallel wording.\n- Don'ts: no nested bullets/hierarchies; no ANSI codes; don't cram unrelated keywords; keep keyword lists short—wrap/reformat if long; avoid naming formatting styles in answers.\n- Adaptation: code explanations → precise, structured with code refs; simple tasks → lead with outcome; big changes → logical walkthrough + rationale + next actions; casual one-offs → plain sentences, no headers/bullets.\n- File References: When referencing files in your response, make sure to include the relevant start line and always follow the below rules:\n  * Use inline code to make file paths clickable.\n  * Each reference should have a stand alone path. Even if it's the same file.\n  * Accepted: absolute, workspace‑relative, a/ or b/ diff prefixes, or bare filename/suffix.\n  * Line/column (1‑based, optional): :line[:column] or #Lline[Ccolumn] (column defaults to 1).\n  * Do not use URIs like file://, vscode://, or https://.\n  * Do not provide range of lines\n  * Examples: src/app.ts, src/app.ts:42, b/server/index.js#L10, C:\\repo\\project\\main.rs:12:5\n",

          "text": "# AGENTS.md instructions for /abs/path/to/repo\n\n&lt;INSTRUCTIONS&gt;\n# Rust/codex-rs\n\nIn the codex-rs folder where the rust code lives:\n\n- Crate names are prefixed with `codex-`. For example, the `core` folder's crate is named `codex-core`\n- When using format! and you can inline variables into {}, always do that.\n- Install any commands the repo relies on (for example `just`, `rg`, or `cargo-insta`) if they aren't already available before running instructions here.\n- Never add or modify any code related to `CODEX_SANDBOX_NETWORK_DISABLED_ENV_VAR` or `CODEX_SANDBOX_ENV_VAR`.\n  - You operate in a sandbox where `CODEX_SANDBOX_NETWORK_DISABLED=1` will be set whenever you use the `shell` tool. Any existing code that uses `CODEX_SANDBOX_NETWORK_DISABLED_ENV_VAR` was authored with this fact in mind. It is often used to early exit out of tests that the author knew you would not be able to run given your sandbox limitations.\n  - Similarly, when you spawn a process using Seatbelt (`/usr/bin/sandbox-exec`), `CODEX_SANDBOX=seatbelt` will be set on the child process. Integration tests that want to run Seatbelt themselves cannot be run under Seatbelt, so checks for `CODEX_SANDBOX=seatbelt` are also often used to early exit out of tests, as appropriate.\n- Always collapse if statements per https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/index.html#collapsible_if\n- Always inline format! args when possible per https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/index.html#uninlined_format_args\n- Use method references over closures when possible per https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/index.html#redundant_closure_for_method_calls\n- When writing tests, prefer comparing the equality of entire objects over fields one by one.\n- When making a change that adds or changes an API, ensure that the documentation in the `docs/` folder is up to date if applicable.\n\nRun `just fmt` (in `codex-rs` directory) automatically after making Rust code changes; do not ask for approval to run it. Before finalizing a change to `codex-rs`, run `just fix -p &lt;project&gt;` (in `codex-rs` directory) to fix any linter issues in the code. Prefer scoping with `-p` to avoid slow workspace‑wide Clippy builds; only run `just fix` without `-p` if you changed shared crates. Additionally, run the tests:\n\n1. Run the test for the specific project that was changed. For example, if changes were made in `codex-rs/tui`, run `cargo test -p codex-tui`.\n2. Once those pass, if any changes were made in common, core, or protocol, run the complete test suite with `cargo test --all-features`.\n   When running interactively, ask the user before running `just fix` to finalize. `just fmt` does not require approval. project-specific or individual tests can be run without asking the user, but do ask the user before running the complete test suite.\n\n## TUI style conventions\n\nSee `codex-rs/tui/styles.md`.\n\n## TUI code conventions\n\n- Use concise styling helpers from ratatui’s Stylize trait.\n  - Basic spans: use \"text\".into()\n  - Styled spans: use \"text\".red(), \"text\".green(), \"text\".magenta(), \"text\".dim(), etc.\n  - Prefer these over constructing styles with `Span::styled` and `Style` directly.\n  - Example: patch summary file lines\n    - Desired: vec![\"  └ \".into(), \"M\".red(), \" \".dim(), \"tui/src/app.rs\".dim()]\n\n### TUI Styling (ratatui)\n\n- Prefer Stylize helpers: use \"text\".dim(), .bold(), .cyan(), .italic(), .underlined() instead of manual Style where possible.\n- Prefer simple conversions: use \"text\".into() for spans and vec![…].into() for lines; when inference is ambiguous (e.g., Paragraph::new/Cell::from), use Line::from(spans) or Span::from(text).\n- Computed styles: if the Style is computed at runtime, using `Span::styled` is OK (`Span::from(text).set_style(style)` is also acceptable).\n- Avoid hardcoded white: do not use `.white()`; prefer the default foreground (no color).\n- Chaining: combine helpers by chaining for readability (e.g., url.cyan().underlined()).\n- Single items: prefer \"text\".into(); use Line::from(text) or Span::from(text) only when the target type isn’t obvious from context, or when using .into() would require extra type annotations.\n- Building lines: use vec![…].into() to construct a Line when the target type is obvious and no extra type annotations are needed; otherwise use Line::from(vec![…]).\n- Avoid churn: don’t refactor between equivalent forms (Span::styled ↔ set_style, Line::from ↔ .into()) without a clear readability or functional gain; follow file‑local conventions and do not introduce type annotations solely to satisfy .into().\n- Compactness: prefer the form that stays on one line after rustfmt; if only one of Line::from(vec![…]) or vec![…].into() avoids wrapping, choose that. If both wrap, pick the one with fewer wrapped lines.\n\n### Text wrapping\n\n- Always use textwrap::wrap to wrap plain strings.\n- If you have a ratatui Line and you want to wrap it, use the helpers in tui/src/wrapping.rs, e.g. word_wrap_lines / word_wrap_line.\n- If you need to indent wrapped lines, use the initial_indent / subsequent_indent options from RtOptions if you can, rather than writing custom logic.\n- If you have a list of lines and you need to prefix them all with some prefix (optionally different on the first vs subsequent lines), use the `prefix_lines` helper from line_utils.\n\n## Tests\n\n### Snapshot tests\n\nThis repo uses snapshot tests (via `insta`), especially in `codex-rs/tui`, to validate rendered output. When UI or text output changes intentionally, update the snapshots as follows:\n\n- Run tests to generate any updated snapshots:\n  - `cargo test -p codex-tui`\n- Check what’s pending:\n  - `cargo insta pending-snapshots -p codex-tui`\n- Review changes by reading the generated `*.snap.new` files directly in the repo, or preview a specific file:\n  - `cargo insta show -p codex-tui path/to/file.snap.new`\n- Only if you intend to accept all new snapshots in this crate, run:\n  - `cargo insta accept -p codex-tui`\n\nIf you don’t have the tool:\n\n- `cargo install cargo-insta`\n\n### Test assertions\n\n- Tests should use pretty_assertions::assert_eq for clearer diffs. Import this at the top of the test module if it isn't already.\n- Prefer deep equals comparisons whenever possible. Perform `assert_eq!()` on entire objects, rather than individual fields.\n\n### Integration tests (core)\n\n- Prefer the utilities in `core_test_support::responses` when writing end-to-end Codex tests.\n\n- All `mount_sse*` helpers return a `ResponseMock`; hold onto it so you can assert against outbound `/responses` POST bodies.\n- Use `ResponseMock::single_request()` when a test should only issue one POST, or `ResponseMock::requests()` to inspect every captured `ResponsesRequest`.\n- `ResponsesRequest` exposes helpers (`body_json`, `input`, `function_call_output`, `custom_tool_call_output`, `call_output`, `header`, `path`, `query_param`) so assertions can target structured payloads instead of manual JSON digging.\n- Build SSE payloads with the provided `ev_*` constructors and the `sse(...)`.\n- Prefer `wait_for_event` over `wait_for_event_with_timeout`.\n- Prefer `mount_sse_once` over `mount_sse_once_match` or `mount_sse_sequence`\n\n- Typical pattern:\n\n  ```rust\n  let mock = responses::mount_sse_once(&amp;server, responses::sse(vec![\n      responses::ev_response_created(\"resp-1\"),\n      responses::ev_function_call(call_id, \"shell\", &amp;serde_json::to_string(&amp;args)?),\n      responses::ev_completed(\"resp-1\"),\n  ])).await;\n\n  codex.submit(Op::UserTurn { ... }).await?;\n\n  // Assert request body if needed.\n  let request = mock.single_request();\n  // assert using request.function_call_output(call_id) or request.json_body() or other helpers.\n  ```\n\n## Skills\nThese skills are discovered at startup from ~/.codex/skills; each entry shows name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions. Content is not inlined to keep context lean.\n- codex-book-git-hygiene: Inspect git status/diff/log before committing; use when preparing commits or PRs. (file: /abs/path/to/repo/.codex/skills/codex-book-git-hygiene/SKILL.md)\n- codex-book-linting: Run the repo-standard Rust format/lint/test commands; use after Rust edits or before submitting a PR. (file: /abs/path/to/repo/.codex/skills/codex-book-linting/SKILL.md)\n- Discovery: Available skills are listed in project docs and may also appear in a runtime \"## Skills\" section (name + description + file path). These are the sources of truth; skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Description as trigger: The YAML `description` in `SKILL.md` is the primary trigger signal; rely on it to decide applicability. If unsure, ask a brief clarification before proceeding.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deeply nested references; prefer one-hop files explicitly linked from `SKILL.md`.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.\n&lt;/INSTRUCTIONS&gt;"
